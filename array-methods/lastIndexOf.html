// Description:
  // The lastIndexOf() method returns the last index at which a given element
  // can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present.
  // The array is searched backwards, starting at fromIndex.


// The Steps
  // 1 write requirements based on docs
  // 2 write description for test
  // 3 write test to fail
  // 4 write code to make the test pass
  // 5 repeat

// Function Signature:
  // lastIndexOf(array, searchElement[, fromIndex]);


// Parameters:
  // array
    // the array being performed on
  // searchElement
    // element to locate in array
  // fromIndex (optional)
    // the index at which to start searching backwards



// Return Value:
  // The last index of the element in the array; -1 if not found.


// Requirements:
  // It should be a type of function.
  // It should accept originalArray as an array as its first argument.
  // It should accept searchElement as a string for its second argument.
  // It should accept searchElement as a number for its second argument.
  // It should accept searchElement as a boolean for its second argument.
  // It should accept searchElement as an array for its second argument.
  // It should accept fromIndex as a number as the third and optional argument.
  // It should return the index of the last element that matches searchElement.
  // It should return -1 if no matches are found.
  // If fromIndex is provided, it should begin the search at this index.
  // If fromIndex is array.length-1, then the whole array should be searched.
  // If fromIndex is greater than or equal to array.length, the whole array should be searched.
  // If fromIndex is not provided, it should default to array.length-1
  // If fromIndex is a negative number, it should be taken as the offset from the end of the array.
  // If fromIndex is a negative number, the array should still be searched from back to front.
  // If fromIndex is less than 0, -1 is returned - (array will not be searched).
  // It should skip unassigned indices.


// This is where the function will go.


// This is where the tests will go.
