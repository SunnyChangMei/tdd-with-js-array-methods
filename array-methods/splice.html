// Docs:
  // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice

// Specs:
  // https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-array.prototype.splice

// Description:
  // The splice() method changes the contents of an array
  // by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements.


// The Steps
  // 1 write requirements based on docs
  // 2 write description for test
  // 3 write test to fail
  // 4 write code to make the test pass
  // 5 repeat

// Function Signature:
  // splice(array,start[, deleteCount[, item1[, item2[,...]]]])


// Parameters:
  // array - the array being operated on
  // start - the index at which to begin changing the array
  // deleteCount - the number of array elements to remove (optional)
  // itemN - the elements to add to the array (optional)



// Return Value:
  // An array containing the deleted elements.
  // If only one element is removed, an array of one element is returned.
  // If no elements are removed, an empty array is returned.


// Requirements:
  // It should accept an array as the first argument.
  // If start is greater than the length of the array, start should be set to the array.length.
  // If start is negative, it should begin that many elements from the end of the array.
  // If start is negative and the absolute value is greater than array.length, then start should be 0.
  // If deleteCount is undefined, then all elements should be deleted.
  // If deleteCount is greater than the number of elements left in the array, then all elements should be deleted.
  // If deleteCount is 0, no elements should be removed.
  // If deleteCount is negative, no elements should be removed.
  // If itemN is provided, these items should be added to the array at start index.
  // If itemN is not provided, only elements will be removed from the array.
  // It should return an array containing the deleted elements.
  // If only one element is removed, an array of one element should be returned.
  // If no elements are removed, an empty array should be returned.
  // If the number of elements to insert is different than the number being removed, the array should have a different length at the end of the call.






// This is where the function will go.


// This is where the tests will go.
